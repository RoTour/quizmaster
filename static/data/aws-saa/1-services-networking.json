          "prompt": "Scenario: A junior admin accidentally deletes the Route Table associated with your Public Subnet. Suddenly, your web servers (which have Public IPs) are unreachable. The admin quickly creates a new Route Table and adds a route 0.0.0.0/0 -> igw-xxxx. He associates it with the subnet. However, traffic is still failing. What did he likely forget? He forgot to reboot the instances to pick up the new route. Not quite Route table changes take effect immediately; no reboot is required. He needs to re-attach the Internet Gateway to the VPC. He forgot to add the 'local' route for the VPC CIDR. Explicitly associate the subnet with the new custom route table. Right answer Creating a table isn't enough; you must explicitly break the association with the Main table by associating with the custom one. He likely triggered a change in the Subnet Association, but network ACLs might be blocking traffic. Enable route propagation. Delete the Main route table. Add a NAT Gateway to the subnet. Show hint This question is a bit tricky. Let's pivot to a clearer scenario about the 'Main' Route Table. Revised Question: A subnet is currently associated with the 'Main' route table, which has no internet access. You create a custom route table with an IGW route.
