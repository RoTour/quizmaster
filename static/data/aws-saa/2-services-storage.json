          "prompt": "True or False: To generate a pre-signed URL, the application must make a network call to the AWS S3 service every time. True Not quite While an API call is used conceptually, the signature is often calculated locally by the SDK without a round-trip to S3 during generation. False Right answer The pre-signing process is a mathematical calculation performed locally by the AWS SDK; S3 only validates it when the URL is actually used.
